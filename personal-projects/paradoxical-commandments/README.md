The Paradoxical Commandments
============================

## Project Description:
I was once asked in an interview what article or book I've read that has had the most positive influence on me. At that time I drew a blank, but after the interview I remembered and regretted not saying The Paradoxical Commandments, as I always find myself coming back to it. I decided to make a web page for others to reading it on. Enjoy.

## Dependencies:
* Internet Browser.

## Opening The Webpage:
1. Download the paradoxical-commandments folder.
2. Unzip and open the folder.
3. Double click the index.html file.

## File Manifest
* index.html
* style.css
* jill-heyer-247995-unsplash.jpg
* README.md
